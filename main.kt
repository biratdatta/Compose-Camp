// Hello World Program

fun main() {

Hello, Android!

The above code is a simple Kotlin program that prints Hello, Android! on the console.

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language. It means that the compiler checks the type of the variable at compile time. The compiler throws an error if the variable is assigned a value of a different type.
